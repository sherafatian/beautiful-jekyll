## Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file directly.  It is much easier to write markdown than HTML, so I suggest you do that (use the [tutorial I mentioned above](http://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown). You can look at some files on this site to get an idea of how to write markdown. To look at existing files, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md). On the next page you can see some nicely formatted text (there is a word in bold, a link, bullet points), and if you click on the pencil icon to edit the file, you will see the markdown that generated the pretty text. Very easy!

In contrast, look at [`index.html`](./index.html). That's how your write HTML - not as pretty. So stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.

Any file that you add inside the [`_posts`](./_posts) directory will be treated as a blog entry.  You can look at the existing files there to get an idea of how to write blog posts.  After you successfully add your own post, you can delete the existing files inside [`_posts`](./_posts) to remove the sample posts, as those are just demo posts to help you learn.

As mentioned previously, you can use [prose.io](http://prose.io/) to add or edit files instead of doing it directly on GitHub, it can be a little easier that way.

## YAML front matter parameters

These are the main parameters you can place inside a page's YAML front matter that **Beautiful Jekyll** supports.

Parameter   | Description
----------- | -----------
title       | Page or blog post title
subtitle    | Short description of page or blog post that goes under the title
bigimg      | Include a large full-width image at the top of the page.  You can either give the path to a single image, or provide a list of images to cycle through (see [my personal website](http://deanattali.com/) as an example).
comments    | If you want do add Disqus comments to a specific page, use `comments: true`. Comments are automatically enabled on blog posts; to turn comments off for a specific post, use `comments: false`. Comments only work if you set your Disqus id in the `_config.yml` file.
show-avatar | If you have an avatar configured in the `_config.yml` but you want to turn it off on a specific page, use `show-avatar: false`. If you want to turn it off by default, locate the line `show-avatar: true` in the file `_config.yml` and change the `true` to `false`; then you can selectively turn it on in specific pages using `show-avatar: true`.
image       | If you want to add a personalized image to your blog post that will show up next to the post's excerpt and on the post itself, use `image: /path/to/img`.
share-img   | If you want to specify an image to use when sharing the page on Facebook or Twitter, then provide the image's full URL here.
social-share | If you don't want to show buttons to share a blog post on social media, use `social-share: false` (this feature is turned on by default).
use-site-title | If you want to use the site title rather than page title as HTML document title (ie. browser tab title), use `use-site-title: true`. When set, the document title will take the format `Site Title - Site Description` (eg. `My website - A virtual proof that name is awesome!`). By default, it will use `Page Title` if it exists, or `Site Title` otherwise.
layout      | What type of page this is (default is `blog` for blog posts and `page` for other pages. You can use `minimal` if you don't want a header and footer)  
js          | List of local JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `/js/mypage.js`)
ext-js      | List of external JavaScript files to include in the page (eg. `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.2/underscore-min.js`). External JavaScript files that support [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) can be specified using the `href` and `sri` parameters eg.<br/>`href: "//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"`<br/>`sri: "sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8="`
css         | List of local CSS files to include in the page
ext-css      | List of external CSS files to include in the page. External CSS files using SRI (see `ext-js` parameter) are also supported. 
googlefonts | List of Google fonts to include in the page (eg. `["Monoton", "Lobster"]`)
gh-repo Â  | If you want to show GitHub buttons at the top of a post, this sets the GitHub repo name (eg. `daattali/beautiful-jekyll`). You must also use the `gh-badge` parameter to specify what buttons to show.
gh-badge  | Select which GitHub buttons to display, available options are: [star, watch, fork, follow]. You must also use the `gh-repo` parameter to specify the GitHub repo.

#### What size do you recommend using for the `bigimg` photos?

Unfortunately, this is a no-answer! There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to this, because every person will view your site on a different browser with different dimensions. Some browsers will have very wide aspect ratio, some will be narrower, some will be vertical (such as phones), different phones have different screens, etc. The image will always be centered, so the only tip I can give is that you should make sure the important part of the image is in the middle so that it'll always show. Other than that, every browser will show a different clipping of the image.
